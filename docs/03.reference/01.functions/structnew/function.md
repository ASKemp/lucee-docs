Creates an empty structure. 

The shorthand syntax for structNew is ``` {}; ```. 
The shorthand syntax for new empty ordered struct is ``` [:]; ``` or ``` [=]; ```. 

You can also create structures with data using this syntax: 

- a normal structure ``` { "key": value }; ```
- a linked/ordered structure use ``` [ "key": value ]; ```
