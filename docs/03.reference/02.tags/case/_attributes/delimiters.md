Specifies the character that separates multiple entries in a list of values. You can specify multiple delimiter characters and you can use any of them to separate the values to be matched. Delimiters can only be used in the tag syntax.

Default delimiter: ,

Note: in [[tag-script]], delimitered values are not supported for case statements. Use an individual case statement for each value.
