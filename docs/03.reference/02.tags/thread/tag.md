The cfthread tag enables you to create threads, independent streams of code execution, in your application.
You use this tag to run or end a thread, temporarily stop thread execution, or join together multiple threads.

You can pass in any additional arguments you like which are then available within the thread in the arguments scope. 

If you are using thread in cfscript, it would be the arguments scope.
