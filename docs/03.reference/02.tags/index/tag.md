Populates collections with indexed data. The [[tag-index]] and [[tag-search]] tags encapsulate the
  indexing and searching utilities. Collections can be populated from text files in a directory
  you specify, or from a query generated by a query. Before you can populate a collection,
  you must create the collection using either the [[tag-collection]] tag or the Lucee Administrator. Use
  cfsearch to search collections you populate with cfindex.
