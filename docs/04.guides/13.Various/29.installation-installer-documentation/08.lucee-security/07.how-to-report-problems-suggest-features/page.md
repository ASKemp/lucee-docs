The Railo Installer project is currently hosted by GitHub, and as such, we can utilize the functionality that the site offers there. There is an issue tracker for the Railo Installer located here:

[https://github.com/viviotech/CFML-Installers/issues](https://github.com/viviotech/CFML-Installers/issues)

Simply hit that URL, and submit the problem report or feature request. We would also encourage you to "watch" the project to know when new features have been added or bugs fixed.

Thank you for your interest!!
