### Permissions ###

The installer requires Administrative rights in order to perform some of the installation tasks it needs to perform. This can result in a windows permission prompt when launching the installer, or a complete "Access Denied" message. Should that happen, you will need to either log in as a user who has access to Administrative rights, or the Administrative user directly.

You will know you need to allow Administrative Access or log in as the Administrator user if your Lucee installer icon has the "shield" on it like the image shows.
