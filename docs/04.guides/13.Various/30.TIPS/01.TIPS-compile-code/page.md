## How do I compile my CFM/CFCs? ##

1. Create a mapping that is called "/" and that points to "/".
1. Then edit the mapping and click on the compile button (untick the stop on errors box).
1. Then you'll find the compiled classes in the folder:	```/WEB-INF/lucee/cfclasses/yourappropiatemappingname/```
