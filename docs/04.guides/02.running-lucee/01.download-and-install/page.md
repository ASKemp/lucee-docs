# Download and Install Lucee Server #
Lucee Server comes in different flavors to match your needs.

## Run without installation ##
"Lucee Express" allows you to test Lucee without installing it.
Simply download a zip, unzip that file and execute a batch file, that's all!
If you are done using that version, simply delete it and it is gone for good!

Download the latest "Express" version [here](https://bitbucket.org/lucee/lucee/downloads) and have fun!

By default the Express version listens on port 8888.

## Installers ##
We provide installers to install Lucee on your platform, bundled with the Tomcat Servlet Engine and the web server connectors necessary.
Simply download the installer for your platform [here](https://bitbucket.org/lucee/lucee/downloads).

## Custom Installation ##
If you want to use Lucee in different environment (with different Servlet Engine), simply download our "Lucee Custom" package [here](https://bitbucket.org/lucee/lucee/downloads), it contains everything you need for this task.
Consult this  [page](Custom_Installation) to get info for how to do this exactly.
