# Lucee Function documentation contribution guide

The current folder stores reference documentation for the Lucee function, **decimalFormat**. Contributions are very welcome and hopefully the information below should help you find your way around.

The `specification.json` file contains the core information for the function such as arguments and other technical details. It potentially also contains cross reference information such as related articles, examples and koans tutorials.

Where you see an `{{include:file}}` directive, paths will be relative to  this directory. For example, you may see `{{include:description.md}}` we should lead you to the `description.md` file in the root of this folder.

By default, long text descriptions for the function and its arguments are stored in separate markdown files to make contributing to those descriptions easier and more flexible. Each argument has its own folder under the `/arguments` folder.
