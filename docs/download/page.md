The documentation is available for offline browsing as a [zip file](lucee-docs.zip) and also as a docset for [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)/[Zealdocs](http://zealdocs.org/).

## Dash / Zeal install

You can add the Lucee documentation to your Dash or Zealdocs install by adding the following feed:

[http://docs.lucee.org/dash/lucee.xml](http://docs.lucee.org/dash/lucee.xml)

Our build process should keep this up to date so that you won't miss all the awesome community contributions that make their way into the docs!
